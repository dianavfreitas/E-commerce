For this project, I created an e-commer website of clothing.
I impleted my knowledge in HMTL, CSS and Javacript to create this website,

For my home page I used materialize for two of the icons in the nav bar, and I created my own logo.
I used insspiration from another clothing brand called Francesca's and added my own ideas, like adding a quote 
at the end of the home page. You are also able to access the products page from any of the buttons I implemented.

For my products page I created the respective JSON file, and during the process I realized it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be,
I would 100% implement JSON files for the next projects if needed. At the bottom of the product page there is a section of "Coming Soon" itemss
which I wanted to create a carrussel of images but decided that to late and I couldn't get it to work.

For my contact form, I used inspiration from the contact form on the code for justice project, and it is validated.
I wasn't a big fan on my contact form but it does whatt it neeeds to do, I ran out of ideas to implement more colors to it.

My website it is kind of responsive, media queries is something that confuses me and no matter how many project I have to put it on,
there is always something that doesn't work out, but I do practice them, and I've gotten beter at them. The responsiveness of the products page 
it is something I'm prouf of, because I didn't run through difficultie, however, they're not the best.
